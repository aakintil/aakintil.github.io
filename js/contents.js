  <p id=''> I worked for <a class='project-links' target='_blank' href='http://clickbrands.com/'>ClickBrands</a> as a Front-End Developer. It was my first real front-end gig and I bloody loved it! Initially, I got my feet wet with a project called <a class='project-links' target='_blank' href='http://www.apartmentlinks.com/'>Apartment Links</a>, but the bulk of our time and effort was spent revamping their old apartment ratings site to Apartment Reviews. The best part was that because we had a small team, I not only did front-end tasks, but I designed mockups, helped with rails logic, and migrated the working front-end prototypes into the rails application. \

We you selected a target audience, developed personas, created a mood board for inspiration, generated concepts, developed a design language and color palette, and designed simple navigation. Our design layouts had to be 768 by 1024 pixels (iPad screen size).\

  <p id=''> This was a course project where we were tasked with choosing an organism, researching various aspects about the organism, and then coming up with a way to apply features of said organism to architecture. Through lots of iterations, ideation, and failure, my team and I designed a responsive building technology based on our initial organism: a pufferfish. We began by reading numerous research documents about pufferfish and learning about the organism's anatomy. At the end of the semester our professor connected us with Nina Barbuto, who is the founder and director of Assemble, an interdisciplinary arts and creativity space in Pittsburgh’s East End. She graciously allowed students from my class and another taught by the same professor to exhibit the prototypes we had been working on during the semester. <br> <br> This was a difficult project for two reasons: it forced my team and myself out of our comfort zones, and our prototypes and designs failed...a lot. But failure is never bad unless you're unable to understand what you did wrong and learn from it. This course taught me to research, design, and build with no constraints. Most, if not all, of my previous projects have had some form of tangible end goal. This was my first time experiencing an truly open ended project: the only end goal was to have something by the end of the semester. I did not like it at the time, but I eventually realized that that is how industry is: a client is going to ask you to build or design 'something' for them, and it's up to you to find a scope and gradually narrow it as you proceed further. \

We started off designing one tile, however, the end goal was to create a design that when rotated and placed together with other tiles, would create a new form or pattern along a wall. \

  <h1> Design. Code. Build. </h1> \
  <p> I'm currently a graduate student studying Human Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. I love design, music, sports, and food. I have this problem where I can't sit still, and although i've dabbled a little with Arduino, dFab, and shop, I would love to get more experience. Ideally an interaction design gig would be awesome, but as long as I am in a situation where I am tasked with helping users in whatever fashion i'm happy! </p> \
