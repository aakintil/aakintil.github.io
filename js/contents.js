  <p id=''> I worked for <a class='project-links' target='_blank' href='http://clickbrands.com/'>ClickBrands</a> as a Front-End Developer. It was my first real front-end gig and I bloody loved it! Initially, I got my feet wet with a project called <a class='project-links' target='_blank' href='http://www.apartmentlinks.com/'>Apartment Links</a>, but the bulk of our time and effort was spent revamping their old apartment ratings site to Apartment Reviews. The best part was that because we had a small team, I not only did front-end tasks, but I designed mockups, helped with rails logic, and migrated the working front-end prototypes into the rails application. \

We had to create a poster for a lecture series that will be displayed in a University Union Building kiosk. We used text and images to communicate informational and emotional content. We produced at least ten sketches of different designs using grid, content, and images. We also employed a variety of typefaces and sizes to explore hierarchy. \

We selected a target audience, developed personas, created a mood board for inspiration, generated concepts, developed a design language and color palette, and designed simple navigation. Our design layouts had to be 768 by 1024 pixels (iPad screen size). You can download the magazine and the process document below, but keep in mind that the magazine is not actually interactive! \

  <p id=''> This was a course project where we were tasked with choosing an organism, researching various aspects about the organism, and then coming up with a way to apply features of said organism to architecture. Through lots of iterations, ideation, and failure, my team and I designed a responsive building technology based on our initial organism: a pufferfish. We began by reading numerous research documents about pufferfish and learning about the organism's anatomy. At the end of the semester our professor connected us with Nina Barbuto, who is the founder and director of Assemble, an interdisciplinary arts and creativity space in Pittsburgh’s East End. She graciously allowed students from my class and another taught by the same professor to exhibit the prototypes we had been working on during the semester. <br> <br> This was a difficult project for two reasons: it forced my team and myself out of our comfort zones, and our prototypes and designs failed...a lot. But failure is never bad unless you're unable to understand what you did wrong and learn from it. This course taught me to research, design, and build with no constraints. Most, if not all, of my previous projects have had some form of tangible end goal. This was my first time experiencing an truly open ended project: the only end goal was to have something by the end of the semester. I did not like it at the time, but I eventually realized that that is how industry is: a client is going to ask you to build or design 'something' for them, and it's up to you to find a scope and gradually narrow it as you proceed further. \

  <p id=''> Another project from my IDM II course. This was our main introduction to laser cutting and parametric modeling. The basic premise of this project was to design a canopy that fulfilled the dimension requirements for the class. Other than that, the model had to be able to assembled when printed. I chose a very simple canopy design: one without waves and drastic increase or decrease in its width. I was not as skilled with Rhino and Grasshopper as the other students, but that is one of the reasons I liked my design. We also had to create an assembly diagram: if someone were to have the waffle canopy pieces, they would be able to assemble it without our help.  \

  <p id=''> This was an exceptional and though provoking course. Every project was team based and recorded onto a team website. Classes were split into lecture / discussions and then work sessions. The lectures were about 'underlying robotic technologies, as they relate to human-robot interaction, interaction methodologies and techniques, study design, ethics and the singularity, and man-machine coupling. Some classes were discussions of application domains that feature HRI. An example of a project we did was researching and designing interactions for automated cars. We had to take into consideration the variables that can occur at an intersection: children, people not paying attention to incoming traffic, visually impaired, etc. Then we brainstormed numerous ways a self-driving vehicle can communicate with pedestrians, and vice versa. In the end we broke our ideas up into three sense categories: audition, sight, and touch. Through our discussions and iterations, we designed an interactive eye around the bottom half of the self-driving vehicle, as well as a vibrating device that would be attached to a stop sign or object near the intersection.  \

  <p id=''> UCRE is an acronym for user centered research & evaluation. It is a required course for Carnegie Mellon's Master of Human Computer Interaction program. UCRE taught us methods and tools to understand, improve, and create technology that harmonizes with and improves human capabilities, goals, and social environments. We learnt methods such as 'think aloud protocols, interviews, log analyses, competitive analyses, contextual design, and much more. We had a couple individual assignments but most were group based where we learnt and practiced research methods. Below are some pictures of the contextual design process my team and I learnt and applied to solving problems in the Computer Science department. You can download some of the documents I worked on (with and without teams) below. If you want more documents, names of team members, or more information about what we did in this course, don't hesitate to shoot me an email!   \
